## Student Activity Evidentioning Using Entity Framework Code-First Solution
[Entity Framework App](https://github.com/arturrrom/Repos/tree/master/CodeFirstBasicStudent/)  
The problem addressed in this solution pertains to the management of a database in an application that employs the Code-First approach with Entity Framework Core. Specifically, the solution focuses on the scenario where it is desirable to remove the existing database before the application runs.
Overall, this solution provides a convenient mechanism to ensure a clean slate for the database each time the application is run, facilitating experimentation and learning in a development environment but it can be simple change to **dynamically adding new records to existing database**

## Technical skills gained
**1. Console Input/Output** The code utilizes Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadLine to interact with the user, prompting them for input and displaying output.  
**2. Variables and Data Types** The code declares variables of integer type (int) to store package weight, width, height, and length. It also uses a variable of decimal type to store the shipping quote.  
**3. Conditional Statements (if statements)** Conditional statements are used to check if the package weight exceeds a certain limit and if the sum of package dimensions exceeds a specified threshold.  
**4. Arithmetic Operators** The code performs arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division to calculate the shipping quote based on package dimensions and weight.  
**5. Control Flow** The program flow is controlled using return statements to exit the program prematurely in case of errors, such as when the package weight or dimensions exceed the allowed limits.  
**6. String Formatting** String interpolation is used to format and display the calculated shipping quote in a human-readable format.  
**7. Polymorphism** While the provided code doesn't explicitly demonstrate polymorphism, the concept could be applied when discussing more advanced scenarios, such as using interfaces or base classes to enable different implementations of methods or behaviors.  
**8. Inheritance** Although the provided code doesn't directly showcase inheritance, it's a fundamental concept in C# where classes can inherit properties and behaviors from a base class. In a more complex application, inheritance could be used to model relationships between different types of packages or shipping services.  
**9. Method Overloading** The code doesn't explicitly demonstrate method overloading, but it's a key feature in C# where multiple methods with the same name can exist in the same class, but with different parameter lists. This allows for flexibility in method invocation based on the provided arguments.  
**10. Classess** Classes are blueprints that define properties and behaviors of objects.  
**11. Methods** Methods are functions defined within classes that specify actions that can be performed on objects of that class.  
**12. Modularity** Classes and methods allow for the modularization of code, making it easier to manage and maintain.  
**13. Encapsulation** Classes can hide internal details and expose only specific methods and properties, improving code cleanliness and security.  
**14. Abstraction** Classes and methods enable programmers to create abstractions, simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential aspects.  
**15. Entity Framework Code-First Approach** This approach is not typically recommended in a production environment, but it can be useful for educational purposes or when prototyping.
The solution can be implemented in an application that examines how much time students need to perform specific activities. We know in advance how long each activity should last. Students are assigned to activities for which the exact, actual start and end dates are specified.
